# Lab2-ML: Network Intrusion Detection with Machine Learning

# Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to explore the Network Intrusion Detection dataset and understand its structure and purpose. This dataset contains records of network traffic, where each record represents either normal activity or an intrusion (attack). The task is to classify network traffic as benign (normal) or malicious (attack) using supervised learning techniques. 

# Machine Learning Type
This is a **Classification problem** because each traffic instance is labeled as either normal or intrusive, and the model learns to predict one of the two classes.

# Dataset Source
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sampadab17/network-intrusion-detection

# Target Variable
The target variable is the **label** that shows whether network traffic is normal or INTRUSION (attack).
